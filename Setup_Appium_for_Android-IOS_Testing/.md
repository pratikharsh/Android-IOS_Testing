## **Step 1: Installation of IntelliJ IDEA** üõ†Ô∏è

Download and install **IntelliJ IDEA** from the official website.

- **Verify**: Open IntelliJ and confirm that the installation was successful.
- **Install**: If not installed, download it from [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

---

## **Step 2: Verify Java Installation** ‚òï

Ensure that **Java** is installed on your local machine.

- **Verify**: Run `java -version` in your terminal.
- **Install**: If not installed, download the **JDK** from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html). After installation, set the environment variables:
  - **JAVA_HOME**: Point this to your JDK directory.
  - Add this directory to your `PATH`.

- **Command**: To add in Windows, go to System Properties > Environment Variables. For macOS/Linux, add this to your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc`.

---

## **Step 3: Verify Maven Installation** üîß

Maven is needed for managing dependencies.

- **Verify**: Run `mvn -version`.
- **Install**: If Maven is not installed, follow these steps:
  - Download from [Maven Apache](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
  - Extract it and set the `MAVEN_HOME` environment variable.
  - Add the Maven `bin` directory to your `PATH`.
  - Verify again by running `mvn -version`.

---

## **Step 4: Install Node.js** üì¶

Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are required for Appium.

- **Verify**: Run `node -v` and `npm -v`.
- **Install**: If missing, download from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), install, and then verify again.
  - **Command**: For macOS/Linux, you can also use a package manager like `brew install node`.

---

## **Step 5: Install Appium** üì≤

Appium is installed using npm.

- **Verify**: Run `appium -v` to check the version.
- **Install**: If Appium is not installed, run the following command:
  - `npm install -g appium`
  - Start the Appium server by typing `appium`.

---

## **Step 6: Install Android SDK** ü§ñ

The **Android SDK** is required for Android automation.

- **Verify**: Open **Android Studio** > SDK Manager > check if the required SDK platforms are installed.
- **Install**: If Android SDK is missing:
  - Download Android Studio from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio).
  - In Android Studio, go to **SDK Manager** and install the required Android platforms.
  - Set `ANDROID_HOME` as an environment variable in your system, pointing it to the SDK directory.
  - Add the SDK tools directory to your `PATH`.

---

## **Step 7: Installation of Vysor** üì±

Install **Vysor** to mirror your Android device's screen on your desktop.

- **Verify**: Ensure you can see your Android screen mirrored on your machine.
- **Install**: If not installed, download Vysor from [here](https://www.vysor.io/), and follow the setup instructions.

---

## **Step 8: Connect Android Phone** üîó

To connect an Android device for testing, enable **Developer Options** and **USB Debugging** on the phone.

- **Verify**: Run `adb devices` to see if the phone is recognized.
- **Fix**: If the device isn't detected:
  - Ensure **USB Debugging** is enabled in **Developer Options**.
  - Install the required **ADB drivers** on your computer.

---

## **Step 9: Define Mobile Device Capabilities** üîç

Appium needs specific **capabilities** for your mobile phone to interact with the device.

- **Verify**: Double-check the accuracy of your desired capabilities (e.g., `platformName`, `deviceName`, `app`).
- **Fix**: If any issue arises, ensure you have captured correct values using `adb shell` for Android or **Xcode** for iOS.

---

## **Step 10: Create a Java Project for Appium Tests** üíª

In **IntelliJ IDEA**, create a new Java project.

- **Verify**: Ensure Maven dependencies are added and resolve without issues.
- **Fix**: If Maven is not resolving dependencies, check your `pom.xml` file and ensure the Appium and Selenium dependencies are added correctly.

---

## **Step 11: Install Appium Drivers** üõ†Ô∏è

Appium requires platform-specific drivers for Android and iOS.

- **Verify**: If tests are not running, ensure the drivers are installed correctly.
- **Install**: To install drivers manually:
  - **Android**: `appium --driver install uiautomator2`
  - **iOS**: `appium --driver install xcuitest`
  - **Verify**: Run `appium driver --list` to ensure they are installed.

---

## **Step 12: Review Appium Documentation** üìö

Review the official Appium documentation to better understand commands and setup for both Android and iOS automation.

- **Link**: [Appium Documentation](https://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/intro/)

---

## **Step 13: Installation of Android SDK Platform Tools** üîß

Make sure **Android SDK Platform Tools** are installed.

- **Verify**: Open Android Studio > SDK Manager, and check if "Platform Tools" are installed.
- **Install**: If not installed, open the SDK Manager and install the required platform tools.

---

## **Step 14: Add `ANDROID_HOME` to Environment Variables** üåç

Set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to point to your Android SDK directory.

- **Verify**: Run `echo $ANDROID_HOME` (Linux/macOS) or `echo %ANDROID_HOME%` (Windows).
- **Fix**: If not set, add it manually by:
  - **Windows**: System Properties > Environment Variables
  - **macOS/Linux**: Add `export ANDROID_HOME=path_to_sdk` in your shell profile (`.bashrc` or `.zshrc`).

---

## **Step 15: Launch Mobile App with Appium Scripts** üìú

Write and run your Appium scripts to launch mobile apps.

- **Verify**: Ensure that the desired capabilities are correct and the app launches without issues.
- **Fix**: If the app doesn't launch, check your device connection, capabilities, and Appium server logs for errors.

---

## **Step 16: Download and Install Appium Inspector** üîç

**Appium Inspector** is used for inspecting elements in your mobile app.

- **Verify**: If Inspector is not opening, ensure the correct Appium server and session are configured.
- **Install**: If not installed, download Appium Inspector from [here](https://github.com/appium/appium-inspector).

---

## **Step 17: Locator Strategies and Selectors** üéØ

Appium supports different locator strategies like XPath, ID, Class Name, and Accessibility ID.

- **Verify**: If elements are not being found, try different locator strategies.
- **Fix**: Use **Appium Inspector** to double-check the selectors and try more efficient locator methods like **Accessibility ID**.

---

## **Step 18: Start Session with Appium Inspector** üñ•Ô∏è

Start a session in **Appium Inspector** to inspect the app elements.

- **Verify**: Make sure Appium Inspector connects to the running Appium server and starts a session.
- **Fix**: If issues occur, check the Appium server logs for errors and ensure the correct desired capabilities are being used.

---

## **Step 19: Capture Selectors for Mobile Apps** üì±

Use **Appium Inspector** to capture element selectors (e.g., XPath, ID) for Android or iOS apps.

- **Verify**: Inspect elements and capture their locators to use them in your scripts.
- **Fix**: If you're unable to capture, verify the Appium Inspector session and ensure the app is running correctly on the connected device.

---

## **Step 20: Writing Appium Scripts** üìù

Write Appium scripts using captured selectors.

- **Verify**: Ensure that the scripts are correctly interacting with the app‚Äôs UI elements.
- **Fix**: If interactions fail, double-check the selectors and re-inspect the elements using Appium Inspector.

---

## **Step 21: iOS Setup for Testing** üçè

Set up your environment to test iOS apps.

- **Verify**: Use **Xcode** to simulate or connect a real iOS device and ensure everything is working.
- **Install**: If Xcode or required tools are missing, download [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and install.
  - **iOS Simulator**: Launch from Xcode to simulate a real iPhone.
  - **Install iOS Drivers**: Run `appium --driver install xcuitest` for iOS automation.

---

## **Step 22: Writing Appium Scripts for iOS** üçé

Write Appium scripts for iOS apps using captured selectors like **Accessibility ID**, **XPath**, or **Class Name**.

- **Verify**: Test scripts on the iOS simulator or connected iOS device.
- **Fix**: If issues arise, check **Xcode logs**, Appium server logs, or use **Appium Inspector** to capture accurate selectors.
